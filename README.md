# zkSNArK-Protocols-Implementation
This Git repository serves as a comprehensive demonstration and implementation of Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (ZKSNARK) protocols using two prominent libraries, Circom and Zokrates. zkSNArK protocols play a vital role in ensuring privacy and integrity in various cryptographic applications by allowing one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information apart from the validity of the statement itself.

Within this repository, you'll find detailed implementations of zkSNArK protocols applied to a variety of problems, showcasing the versatility and power of these cryptographic techniques. The repository includes demonstrations of the following problems:

- Factorization:
utilizing zkSNARK protocols to prove knowledge of the factors of a given number without revealing the factors themselves. This demonstrates the application of zkSNARKs in secure computation of factorization, preserving the confidentiality of the factors.

- Age Demonstration:
Implementation of zkSNArK protocols to verify if an individual is of a certain age without disclosing their actual age or any other personal information. This showcases the utility of zkSNArKs in age verification scenarios, ensuring privacy while still validating the age requirement.

- Sudoku:
application of zkSNArK protocols to prove the correctness of a solved Sudoku puzzle without revealing the actual solution. This demonstrates how zkSNArKs can be applied in verifying solutions to complex puzzles while maintaining confidentiality.

- Hamiltonian Cycle:
implementation of zkSNArK protocols to verify the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in a given graph without disclosing the cycle itself. This showcases the applicability of zkSNArKs in graph theory and combinatorial optimization problems while preserving data privacy.

It offers insights into the underlying principles of zkSNArK protocols and their significance in modern cryptography. Developers and researchers interested in understanding and applying ZKSNARK protocols to various real-world problems will find this repository to be a valuable resource for experimentation and learning.
